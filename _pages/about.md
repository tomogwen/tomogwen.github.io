I'm a PhD student in the [AIC group](https://www.aic.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) at [Southampton University](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/), supervised by [Long Tran-Thanh](https://human-agentlearning.github.io/) and [Corina Cirstea](https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/corina) from Computer Science and [Ruben Sanchez-Garcia](http://www.personal.soton.ac.uk/rsg1y09/RSG/About_Me.html) from Mathematics. My research aims to combine tools from topological data analysis with machine learning to enable topology-driven deep learning. Our paper [Hypothesis classes with a unique persistence diagram are nonuniformly learnable](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=Ay-RgChnje) provides the first learning theoretic justification for the inclusion of persistence-based terms in loss functions, and was [presented](https://slideslive.com/38941574/hypothesis-classes-with-a-unique-persistence-diagram-are-nonuniformly-learnable) as a spotlight presentation at the TDA and Beyond 2020 NeurIPS 2020 workshop.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a Mathematics MSci from the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/). My masters project, [The Persistent Homology of Complexes from Point Data Sets](https://tomogwen.github.io/files/Persistent_Homology.pdf), studied the algebraic topology underpinning topological data analysis.

My [CV](https://tomogwen.github.io/cv/) details my work experience, which includes developing an end-to-end data science pipeline for an automotive start-up; leading a team of edtech developers implementing automated mathematical assessments; and spending a summer as a cyber security intern in the public sector.
