I'm a machine learning PhD student in the [AIC group](https://www.aic.ecs.soton.ac.uk/) at [Southampton University](https://www.southampton.ac.uk/). My research aims to combine tools from topological data analysis with machine learning to enable topology-driven deep learning. I'm interested in both the theoretical study of machine learning, with a focus on TDA-based algorithms, and applications of ML to other disciplines: in my [first paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.02796) we develop a novel topological fuzzy clustering algorithm that can classify transformed datasets from materials science where comparable algorithms fail. 

Before starting my PhD, I got a Mathematics MSci at the [University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/). My masters project, [The Persistent Homology of Complexes from Finite Data Sets](https://tomogwen.github.io/files/Persistent_Homology.pdf), studied the algebraic topology underlying Topological Data Analysis.

My [CV](https://tomogwen.github.io/files/CV.pdf) details my work experience, which includes developing an end-to-end data science pipeline for an automotive start-up; leading a team of edtech developers implementing automated mathematical assessments; and spending a summer as a cyber security intern in the public sector.
